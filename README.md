# Unity-BearCat-Game
3D game made in Unity and written in C#

In the game, the player plays a bear that tries to eat all the candy before the Cats have killed him. I made this game from the 'Survival Shooter' tutorial on the Unity website.
For more difficulty I made the camera face the bear from the front so that you are more confused of where you are in the game and added a map to see where the candy, the cats and you are.

You can play the game online here: http://leoniesijtsma.nl/UnityBearCat/
Please wait a few minutes to let it load itself.

Issues:
- Cat continues to attack the player (Bear) even after the player has won.
